  rst-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: GPIO to which the RST pin of the device is connected and on which the Power-On-Reset will be performed.

  sampling-rate:
    type: int
    description: Adjusts the sensitivity setting on trackpoint devices. The allowed values are 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200 and the default is 100.
    enum:
      - 10
      - 20
      - 40

      - 80
      - 100
      - 200

  disable-clicking:
    type: boolean
    description: Disables clicking. Useful when using a PS2 driver that is prone to erros in transmissions to reduce accidental clicks.

  tp-press-to-select:
    type: boolean
    description: Enables mouse clicking by pressing hard on the trackpoint. Not all trackpoints support this feature.

  tp-press-to-select-threshold:
    type: int
    description: Adjusts how sensitive the press-to-select feature is. The range is 0 - 255 and the default is 8. You can also adjust this setting at runtime without recompiling using the &mms behavior. If this setting is enabled, then the runtime behavior won't be saved into the runtime settings.

  tp-sensitivity:
    type: int
    description: Adjusts the sensitivity setting on trackpoint devices. The range is 0 - 255 and the default is 128. You can also adjust this setting at runtime without recompiling using the &mms behavior. If this setting is enabled, then the runtime behavior won't be saved into the runtime settings.

  tp-neg-inertia:
    type: int
    description: Adjusts the negative inertia setting on trackpoint devices. The range is 0 - 255 and the default is 6. You can also adjust this setting at runtime without recompiling using the &mms behavior. If this setting is enabled, then the runtime behavior won't be saved into the runtime settings.

  tp-val6-upper-speed:

  layer-toggle-delay-ms:
    type: int
    default: 250
    required: false
    description: How many miliseconds of mouse activity are required before the layer is toggled on.

  layer-toggle-timeout-ms:
    type: int
    default: 250
    required: false
    description: How many miliseconds of mouse inactivity are required before the layer is toggled off again.
